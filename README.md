# PYTHONFLASK-CapstoneOne

## A site that makes external API calls to the NASA Rover API allowing user to find photos for all the days of a particular rover voyage.
## If a user registers and logs in they can save photos to a personal photo album. 

### Uses Python and Flack backend.  Other libraries used:  ### Deployed through Heroku at: SqlAlchemy, WTForms, Jinja, Bootstrap  

### Deployed through Heroku at: https://nasa-photo-album.herokuapp.com/

#### If you clone in addition to pip install -r requirements text, the NASA API is imported as API_SECRET_KEY from secrects.py.  So you will
#### need to generate your own API key at https://api.nasa.gov/ and create your on secrets.py with the key stored (literally just a file with API_SECRET_KEY = "aed...")
### But to just see the site please go to where it is deployed on Heroku.
